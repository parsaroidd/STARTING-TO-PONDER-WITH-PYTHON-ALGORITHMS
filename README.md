# STARTING-TO-PONDER-WITH-PYTHON-ALGORITHMS
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I UPLOADED TOO MUCH IT IS GETTING GONFUSING 
.the final version 
. i just made it much simpler, storing numbers of cells instead of x and y axis and used a list instead of dictionary.
. i learned the basics of recursion and some cool stuff!

version 0.1 (yes it is less than 0 cuz it doesn't work.
. this program knows all the possible moves
. can see where you can go for the first move
. can take care of 8x8 chess table and can take input from the user 
-- not visual yet, input handling is strict 
-- recursive function is not functional... YET

i wanna make a knight piece in chess to move all the blocks on the chess table without like stepping on a block twice, but i can't do crap with stuff i know now, so i started this journey on 16th of September to learn some algorithm like a real man...

first commit: recursive backtracking.
this is my first lesson that i watched from greg hogg on youtube, I'll upload it as a study refrence.
